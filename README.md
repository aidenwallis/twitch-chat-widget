# twitch-chat-widget

The Twitch chat widget I use on my personal streams on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Aiden).

Currently the Twitch ID and username is hardcoded with env variables because I am too lazy to add API support :).

## Running it locally

1. Clone the repo.
1. Run `yarn`.
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
1. Fill in your user ID and login in the `.env` file. It defaults to my own user ID and login.
1. Run `yarn start` to start the dev server.

## Building it

1. `yarn build`
1. That's it.
